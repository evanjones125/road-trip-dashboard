# trip-dashboard

enter the desination of a trip and the dashboard will display the nearest traffic road cam and the weather of the nearest town, saving the user time of searching that information separately

future features:
- show weather data from the NWS API
- show sunrise/sunset times
- show moonrise/moonset times
  - tell the user what time window they'll have to view the sky after sunset when there's no moon in the sky
- show milky way information
- let user choose a location on a map when submitting the new trip form (as an alternative to entering an exact latitude and longitude)

purpose of this app:
when I'm planning a trip to see the outdoors in Utah, there's always a potential for weather conditions to create logistical challenges. snow can create dangerous conditions for hiking, clouds can obscure the nightly show of stars and galaxies, and rain can make dirt roads impassable for more obscure locations. I usually find myself checking weather forecasts and traffic cameras several times a day in the week leading up to my travel date — often for multiple locations that may be chained together for a single trip. this app consolidates all the information that I would regularly be checking — cloud coverage, precipitation predictions, park entrance traffic, and road cameras – helping me to either anticipate poor conditions or gain a peace of mind about my plans.
